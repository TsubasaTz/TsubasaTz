# Hello! 👋
Welcome to my page! Allow me to introduce myself...
- 🌸 My name is Maggie Nguyen
- 🍀 I am currently 19 years old
- ✨ I attend Santa Monica College (SMC) majoring in Computer Engineering! 
- 💖 My passions are robotics and graphic design! However, I have a strong interest in programming
- 🎹 I've played the piano for 11 years now! 

In my free time you can find me working on graphic design commissions for roblox developers! I do freelance graphic design as a side gig so it's always fun to do. 
That's not all! I've also been playing piano for 11 years now. 
Yet I'm not only just a pianist, I'm an advid romance enjoyer! I read manga, webtoons, manhwas, and novels! 
When it comes to movies, I love all disney movies, interstellar, and shows such as Stranger Things and The Boys. I also love kdramas and anime! Especially in the romance genre.

Currently, I've taken classes for C and C++ Programming.
